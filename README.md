# Stock-Analysis

### 1. Overview of Project:
##### Taking a previously prepared stocks analysis file that summarizes tickers by daily volume and return and refactoring the code to run faster and more efficiently. We have stock data for 12 tickers from 2017 and 2018.

### 2. Results:
##### After refactoring the code the analysis for all stock 2017 and 2018 displayed the exact same results.

##### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    -Outside of very low goals (Less Than $1,000), plays with goals between $35,000 to $40,000 and $40,000 to $45,000 have the highest success rate

##### What are some limitations of this dataset?
    -We only have two fields to break data down into smaller groups (parent category and subcategory). More categories can help drill down further into the dataset.

##### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    -I thought a Histogram would be helpful to look at Goal vs Number Successful since most successful campaigns have a goal of under $20,000
