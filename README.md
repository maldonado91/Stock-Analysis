# Stock-Analysis

### 1. Overview of Project:
##### Taking a previously prepared stocks analysis file that summarizes tickers by daily volume and return and refactoring the code to run faster and more efficiently. We have stock data for 12 tickers from 2017 and 2018.

### 2. Results:
##### After refactoring the code the analysis for all stock 2017 and 2018 displayed the exact same results. 
![All-Stocks_2017](https://github.com/maldonado91/Stock-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/All_Stocks_2017.png) ![All-Stocks_2018](https://github.com/maldonado91/Stock-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/All_Stocks_2018.png)
##### However, the run time was much different in both instances. We saw much faster times, therefore, acheiving our goals of enhancing code performance.

##### You can find final project VBA code [here.](https://github.com/maldonado91/Stock-Analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_Complete.vbs)

### 3. Summary:
##### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
    -The advantages are certainly improved code. We were able to leverage arrays to provide our output and we only had to run through the rows of tickers one time.

##### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
    -In this particular example we established quicker run times which will allow us the potential to analyze more information and additional years.
